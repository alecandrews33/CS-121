Write the relational model schema for your airline database in this file, using
the notation we have used all term.  You can indicate primary key columns by
enclosing the attribute names in _ characters.  Include descriptions of other
candidate keys or foreign keys (if any) immediately under each relation schema.
Example:

foo(_a_, b, c)
 * b is also a candidate key
 * c is a foreign key to bar.c

flights(_flight_number_, _date_, time, departure, destination, flight_type, type_code)
 * type_code is a foreign key to aircraft.type_code
 * Putting type_code in flights covers the relationship between 
 * flights and aircraft. Each flight is given one aircraft. 

aircraft(_type_code_, manufacturer, model)

seats(_type_code_, _seat_number_, seat_class, seat_type, exit_row)
 * type_code is put in seats because it is the primary key 
 * of seats' identifying entity. Thus, the primary key of
 * seats is type_code U seat_number, since seat_number was 
 * the discriminator of the weak entity set. 

consumer(_consumer_ID_, first_name, last_name, email)

consumer_phone(_consumer_ID_, _phone_number_)
 * consumer_ID foreign key to consumer.consumer_ID
 * This relation is needed since a consumer can have multiple
 * phone numbers. 

purchase(_purchase_ID_, purchase_time, confirmation_number, consumer_ID)
 * consumer_ID foreign key to purchaser.consumer_ID
 * Every purchase belongs to one purchaser. Purchasers can make multiple
 * purchases. 

purchaser(_consumer_ID_, card_number, exp_date, verification_code)
 * consumer_ID foreign key to consumer.consumer_ID

traveler(_consumer_ID_, frequent_flyer, passport_number, citizen_of, emergency_contact, 
           emergency_phone)
 * consumer_ID foreign key to consumer.consumer_ID

ticket(_ticket_ID_, sale_price, purchase_ID, consumer_ID)
 * (purchase_ID, consumer_ID) foreign key to purchase (purchase_ID, consumer_ID)

seat_ticket(_flight_number_, _flight_date_, _type_code_, _seat_number_, ticket_id)
 * (type_code, seat_number) foreign key to seats
 * (flight_number, flight_date) foreign key to flights
 * ticket_id is a candidate key. It is a foreign key to ticket.ticket_id.
